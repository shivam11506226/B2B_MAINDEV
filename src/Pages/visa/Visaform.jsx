                            <Typography sx={{ color: '#707070', fontSize: '12px', }}> A Visa is an official certificate of endorsement on your passport giving you the permission to enter, stay and leave a particular country, whether permanently or for a specific period of time. A visa is issued to you by the immigration authorities of the country you intend to travel to after verifying your credentials, the accuracy of your submitted visa form and other necessary documents. Many countries such as UK and USA among others grant you visa only after an in-person interview with the immigration officers. Of all kinds of visas, tourist visas are less hassle and always easy to gain. Where no physical interview is required a visa is even sent to you electronically. Although, the visa is a grant to entry, your actual entry into a foreign country is only subject to approval from the immigration officer at the point of entry.
